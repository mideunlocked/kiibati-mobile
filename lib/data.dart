  "Your experience in life is a product of your faithfulness to God and His instructions. Your attitude to the word of God determines how God deals with you in life. ",
  "Your faithfulness to the word of God determines how things work out for you.  You are the one who determines how things turn out for you through your response to Jesus and His teachings and instructions to you. So, commit to listening and taking heed to the teachings of the Bible. Make up you mind to apply the word of God in every area of your life and at all times. The word works.",
  "God is committed to His words and makes sure they prove true. If you love the Lord Jesus, you will obey Him always. Do not drag your feet in doing the will of the Lord. Let the “word” be you guide and strength. Obeying God is walking in the covenant. Do not forget that God is a covenant keeper.  I pray you will not be a hearer of the word only, but a doer in Jesus name.",
